About me

Do you like to know how things work? Me too! That's how I got here. I have always been a big believer in self development
and personal growth, so in June 2021 when I knew I needed a career change, I put all of my likes and dislikes into an algorithm
and one of the top choices was programming.

So after doing some learning in my own time I was quickly enthralled, as the depth of the subject is immense, however I knew that 
my previous job and other interests had given me a lot of the tools I would need to prepare for this.

Then I quit my job! Did a part time bootcamp in Creative Computing and did self study through The Odin Project in my remaining free
time. Before eventually being selected by Deloitte and GDS to form part of their new "Tech Hub" in Bristol and being enrolled on
the Makers bootcamp to help me prepare.
