About me

Do you like to know how things work? Me too! That's how I got here. I have always been a big believer in self development
and personal growth, so in June 2021 when I knew I needed a career change, I put all of my likes and dislikes into an algorithm
and one of the top choices was programming.

So after doing some learning in my own time I was quickly enthralled, as the depth of the subject is immense, however I knew that 
my previous job and other interests had given me a lot of the tools I would need to prepare for this.

Then I quit my job! Did a part time bootcamp in Creative Computing and did self study through The Odin Project in my remaining free
time. Before eventually being selected by Deloitte and GDS to form part of their new "Tech Hub" in Bristol and being enrolled on
the Makers bootcamp to help me prepare.

## Skills


In my previous job we had an issue with people having to return to jobs as they had either not fixed something that needed repairing or failed to complete the relevant paperwork which led to high costs 
and affecting profit, so I wrote a step by step manual that was distributed to all relevant workers that explicitly explained every step required and all results and paperwork that would be required
depending on the work type. This led to a significant decrease in recalls for our work and allowed more jobs to be completed as a result.
